## Motivation
I understand the power of LinkedIn in career development, which is why I aim to
extract the most out of the platform. However, tasks like engaging, connecting,
and job searching can be tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, I decided to
automate various tasks within LinkedIn in a flexible and scalable manner.
